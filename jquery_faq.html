                        President
                        Theodore Roosevelt
                        during the year 1916. The goal was to give American people the opportunity to enjoy public lands
                        and
                        make recreational activity more accessible to the public.

                    <dt>Who is in charge of the national parks?</dt>
                    <dd class="invisible">All national parks in the United States are managed and and supervised by the
                        National Park Service,
                        which is a federal agency of the Department of Interior. Park rangers operate as federal law
                        enforcement officers inside a national park, with full authority to protect the people and the
                        nature inside of each park.

                    <dd class="invisible">The best way to enjoy nature in a national park is to spend as much time
                        outside
                        as possible and
                        less time in the car. Before entering a national park, create a plan highlighting certain hikes
                        and
                        view points. If you are able, take at least a one-mile hike away from parking areas to enjoy
                        more
                        silence and natural surroundings. Explore on foot, by bike or paddled vessel to get more in
                        touch
                        with nature in any national park.
