                    National Park Service,
                    which is a federal agency of the Department of Interior. Park rangers operate as federal law
                    enforcement officers inside a national park, with full authority to protect the people and the
                    nature inside of each park.

                <dt>What is the best way to explore nature?</dt>
                <dd class="invisible">The best way to enjoy nature in a national park is to spend as much time outside
                    as possible and
                    less time in the car. Before entering a national park, create a plan highlighting certain hikes and
                    view points. If you are able, take at least a one-mile hike away from parking areas to enjoy more
                    silence and natural surroundings. Explore on foot, by bike or paddled vessel to get more in touch
                    with nature in any national park.
